IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR SPIKE4

STAGING THE DEVELOPMENT

 - spike4 involves several substantial changes involving a significant
   development effort and time.  Implementors may wish to consider
   this approximate timeline as guidance:

   = Preparation (0.5-1 days): Skimming the spec and preparing a
     spike4 framework from the existing spike3.  Second spec reading.

   = Control statements (1-1.5 days): Implementing IF_STMT and
     WHILE_STMT -- in absence of any other spike4 elements -- is
     perhaps the easiest place to start.

   = Recursive BLOCKS (1-3 days, depending how suitable is the spike3
     design): Creating a symbol table per block, and mechanisms to
     perform nearest-enclosing-scope symbol lookups while walking the
     AST.

   = Type labeling (2-3 days): Actually getting the tree labeled often
     involves significant rework of tree nodes and type system
     internals.  As the type labeling design begins to settle,
     development of constant folding will need to commence.

   = Constant folding (1-3 days): Once the framework for tree
     traversing and type labeling starts to be believable, constant
     folding is sometimes easier.  The resulting 'tree surgeries',
     however, can create expensive bugs unless the implementor is
     clean and careful.

   = Aggregate debugging time (1-1000 days): Always Be Cleaning.
